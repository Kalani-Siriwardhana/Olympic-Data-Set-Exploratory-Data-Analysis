The International Olympic Committee, which was set up in 1894 and the first modern Olympics were held in 1896.

The project will make you understand how to analyze and visualize past Olympics data for drawing crucial insights. This project will teach you how to use Python libraries (Seaborn) and their associated functions to create interesting visualizations and analyze vast amounts of data.
